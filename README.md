# Hotel Management Dashboard

## Problem Statement

This dashboard is designed to help hotel management analyze key performance metrics effectively. It provides insights into revenue streams, room utilization, and trends over time, enabling better decision-making for optimizing operations and maximizing profitability. The dashboard focuses on metrics such as Revenue, RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room), Daily Sellable Room Nights (DSRN), Occupancy %, and others, which are critical for understanding the performance and efficiency of hotel operations.

## Visualizations Included

- **Revenue**: This visualization provides a detailed analysis of the hotel's total revenue, helping to identify the top-performing categories and periods.
  
- **RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room)**: This metric helps in understanding the revenue generated per available room, allowing the management to assess room pricing strategies.

- **DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights)**: This visualization tracks the total number of rooms available for sale each day, providing insight into room availability and potential revenue opportunities.

- **Occupancy %**: This shows the percentage of occupied rooms out of the total sellable rooms, helping to gauge the hotel's capacity utilization.

- **Property by Key Metrics**: This section displays key metrics by property, offering a comparative view of performance across different locations or properties.

- **Trend by Key Metrics**: This visualization presents the trends of various key metrics over time, helping to identify patterns and seasonal impacts on the hotel's performance.

- **% Revenue by Category**: This shows the distribution of revenue across different categories, such as room types or booking platforms, helping to identify the most profitable segments.

- **Realization %**: This metric shows the percentage of expected revenue realized, which is crucial for understanding revenue leakage or underperformance.

## Steps Followed

1. **Load Data**: The data was loaded into Power BI Desktop from a CSV file.
2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Power Query Editor was used to clean and transform the data. Column profiling was performed on the entire dataset.
3. **Error Handling**: Any errors or empty values were addressed, ensuring the dataset's integrity.
4. **Visualizations**: Appropriate visuals were chosen to represent the key metrics effectively.
5. **Publishing**: The dashboard was created in Power BI Desktop, and snapshots of the dashboard have been shared due to license restrictions on public sharing.
